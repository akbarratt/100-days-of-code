# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the #100DaysOfCode repo, made adjustments to the goals, and spent 50 minutes reading and taking notes on [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

**Thoughts:** I forgot I was supposed to start this challenge today and I am very, very tired.

### Day 3: May 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent 30 minutes finishing  [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) chapter 2. Reviewed loops and basic concepts.

**Thoughts:** There are some exercises tomorrow that I'm excited to try. Just reading gets a little tiresome.

**Link to work:** Just reading today.


### Day 4: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent ~1 hour completing chapter 2 exercises in [Marijn Haverbeke's "Eloquent JavaScript"](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). Passed 2/3.

**Thoughts:** My solutions were inelegant and cumbersome compared to the "correct" answers, but I was able to reach them on my own without assistance, so I feel I am grasping the concepts. I'm not sure how I was supposed to solve the final problem relying solely on the information given in the chapter. I'm not going to fault myself for failing that one. Though targeted at beginners, some aspects of this book have been difficult to understand.
