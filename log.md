# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the #100DaysOfCode repo, made adjustments to the goals, and spent 50 minutes reading and taking notes on [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

**Thoughts:** I forgot I was supposed to start this challenge today and I am very, very tired.

**Link to work:** You're looking at it.

### Day 2: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent 50 minutes reading and taking notes on [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). Understanding basic functions.

**Thoughts:** I'm still sleepy. Just trying to work a bit every day.

**Link to work:** [Here's some code I typed up while following along with the book.](

### Day 3: May 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent 30 minutes finishing  [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) chapter 2. Reviewed loops and basic concepts.

**Thoughts:** There are some exercises tomorrow that I'm excited to try. Just reading gets a little tiresome.

**Link to work:** Just reading today.


### Day 4: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent ~1 hour completing chapter 2 exercises in [Marijn Haverbeke's "Eloquent JavaScript"](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). Passed 2/3.

**Thoughts:** My solutions were inelegant and cumbersome compared to the "correct" answers, but I was able to reach them on my own without assistance, so I feel I am grasping the concepts. I'm not sure how I was supposed to solve the final problem relying solely on the information given in the chapter. I'm not going to fault myself for failing that one. Though targeted at beginners, some aspects of this book have been difficult to understand.

### Day 5: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Discovered that contributions to forked repositories don't count as commits on GitHub profiles. So (reviewing git in the process), cloned the previous repository to my hard drive, initialized a new repository, and copied my progress, which should now count in my activity log.

Later today spent about 30 minutes backing up old websites using git and checking out my unused Wordpress blog. Ultimately a bit of a waste of time as I'll have to start actually using it before knowing what improvements to make, but it helped me focus my goals nevertheless.

**Thoughts:** I need to identify some practical projects to work on while I work on my JS course. I think if I have time I will focus on making a static landing page for my main website. I also bought a course of practical projects I can revisit if I get bored of theory.

**Link to work:** It's all here on GitHub today.


### Day 6: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to more active tutorials, reviewed the material I had previously covered on DOM maniupulation and single element selectors in the [Traversy Media Course on vanilla JS](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WqkBEUeeV5STXo=/) I've been trying to make my way through.

**Thoughts:** I feel more confident this time around. A little rusty in my HTML/CSS but I'm confident it will come back to me. Tomorrow may try some of my own experiments using this template.

I'm also realizing I really need to resume my habit of creating flash cards in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) as I learn. It is a slower learning process but retentions is leaps and bounds better. I would find it less frustrating and there would be less need for review every time I sit down.

### Day 7: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Multiple element selectors today. I understand the function, it's the syntax that's a little bit difficult to rememeber.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it's been a whole week.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/exercises/DOM-Manipulation


### Day 8: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More DOM manipulation, including creation and insertion of HTML elements into the DOM from JS. Pretty cool!

**Thoughts:** I've got about an hour left in this tutorial before the first project. I do want to finish up before I proceed but I'm getting a little antsy because I think I've already figured out how to do it.

### Day 9: May 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much time today and didn't feel like listening to a tutorial so put on some music and tried my best to replicate the test document with the HTML I remember.

**Thoughts:** I actually did pretty well. Needed a reminder on some tags, but the move to semantic tags in HTML5 makes structuring a document much easier to follow. Unfortunately when double checking the tutorial document, I realized it's reliant on Bootstrap and is an absolute clusterfuck of `<div>`s. Will probably end up rewriting from the ground up when I do it myself. It's a simple page, I don't anticipate much difficulty other than styling.

### Days 10-12: May 8, 10, 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still working through tutorial. Learning about DOM manipulation and now Event Listeners.

**Thoughts:** I keep forgetting to log. :neutral_face:

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/blob/master/exercises/DOM-Manipulation/app.js

### Day 13: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Messing around with mouse events.

**Thoughts:** I can see some practical applications for some of the weird things you can do with JS.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/blob/master/exercises/DOM-Manipulation/app.js

### Day 14: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More event listeners! Input events!

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking of some practical projects that can be done with what I've learned, although there are a few coming up in the tutorial as well.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/blob/master/exercises/DOM-Manipulation/app.js

### Day 15: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Even more event listeners.

**Thoughts:** I'm very tired.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/blob/master/exercises/DOM-Manipulation/app.js

### Day 16: May 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about event bubbling and delegation. Seems like a lot of puzzle solving.

**Thoughts:** Realized how useful logging to the console can be when testing functions.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/blob/master/exercises/DOM-Manipulation/app.js

### Day 18: May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Starting my task list project. Doing the static HTML page and styling first. Had to review some things.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to start on something practical!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 19: May 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added basic styling. Ready to start on the JS tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Had to look up a lot of reference but was surprised by how much I remembered.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 20: May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got started on some basic JS functionality. X buttons now remove tasks from the list. When there are no tasks, the entire container is hidden.

**Thoughts:** Took a lot of troubleshooting, but I let myself struggle with it. I don't struggle with the concepts and syntax as much as the logic and order of operations.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 21: May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to finalize the functionality to add a new task to the list. Didn't quite get there but I'm at a stopping point.

**Thoughts:** Discovered some pretty funny bugs.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 22: May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed yesterday's bug, created some new ones.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to get to a stopping point. Tried to write myself good notes so I could pick up easily but there's still a lot of time spent grinding gears trying to figure out where I left off.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 23: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed more bugs today. The basic functionality is down and I added some more styles. More styling and functions in the days to come.

**Thoughts:** I need a refresher on flexbox.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 24: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dipped back into [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). It was clear I was having trouble understanding scope so wanted to try it from a different angle.

**Thoughts:** Might need another day or two on this.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 25: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read further on functions and their scope in [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). Also found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhSCEWHazAU) to be helpful.

**Thoughts:** My eyes are tired.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 26: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: This chapter is 25 pages and I read very slow.

**Thoughts:** It's time for bed.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 27: June 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back on it. I hit a wall with my task list so decided to go ahead and move forward by reviewing the tutorial and see how my attempt differed.

**Thoughts:** I did a pretty good job! I'm proud of my solutions, even if they were cumbersome. I would like to learn more JS "best practices" and workflow, but I do learn best by just digging in, even though it goes against my predispositions.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 28: June 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Moving ahead, I missed some functionality so created a list of features to add and work on tomorrow. Reviewed which methods return a node list vs. HTML collection. Still confusing.

**Thoughts:** Only had a little time today but better than nothing.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 29: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did a deep dive on memory in the browser.

**Thoughts:** Still having a hard time understanding, but I'm thinking this may be one of those things you just have to learn with practice.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 30: July 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to add functionality to the clear tasks button so added that in.

**Thoughts:** I could spend forever perfecting this one project, but probably best to move on soon.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 31: July 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JSON.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite tired.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 32: July 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Realized I was reusing some code in the show/hide list container feature so abstracted it into its own function.

**Thoughts:** It was a lot easier than I expected. I'm starting to wrap my head around the core concepts.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 33: July 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added a function to filter tasks.

**Thoughts:** Hard to figure out the layout on this one. Don't love the styling.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 34: July 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on the filter. Rewrote it. Broke it. Try again tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Meh.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/akbarratt/100-days-of-code/tree/master/projects/tasklist

### Day 35: July 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed filter, but broke some styles in the process.

**Thoughts:** I really struggle to come up with semantic names for functions and keywords.
