# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the #100DaysOfCode repo, made adjustments to the goals, and spent 50 minutes reading and taking notes on [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

**Thoughts:** I forgot I was supposed to start this challenge today and I am very, very tired.

**Link to work:** You're looking at it.

### Day 2: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent 50 minutes reading and taking notes on [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). Understanding basic functions.

**Thoughts:** I'm still sleepy. Just trying to work a bit every day.

**Link to work:** [Here's some code I typed up while following along with the book.](

### Day 3: May 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent 30 minutes finishing  [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) chapter 2. Reviewed loops and basic concepts.

**Thoughts:** There are some exercises tomorrow that I'm excited to try. Just reading gets a little tiresome.

**Link to work:** Just reading today.


### Day 4: May 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent ~1 hour completing chapter 2 exercises in [Marijn Haverbeke's "Eloquent JavaScript"](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). Passed 2/3.

**Thoughts:** My solutions were inelegant and cumbersome compared to the "correct" answers, but I was able to reach them on my own without assistance, so I feel I am grasping the concepts. I'm not sure how I was supposed to solve the final problem relying solely on the information given in the chapter. I'm not going to fault myself for failing that one. Though targeted at beginners, some aspects of this book have been difficult to understand.

### Day 5: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Discovered that contributions to forked repositories don't count as commits on GitHub profiles. So (reviewing git in the process), cloned the previous repository to my hard drive, initialized a new repository, and copied my progress, which should now count in my activity log.

Later today spent about 30 minutes backing up old websites using git and checking out my unused Wordpress blog. Ultimately a bit of a waste of time as I'll have to start actually using it before knowing what improvements to make, but it helped me focus my goals nevertheless.

**Thoughts:** I need to identify some practical projects to work on while I work on my JS course. I think if I have time I will focus on making a static landing page for my main website. I also bought a course of practical projects I can revisit if I get bored of theory.

**Link to work:** It's all here on GitHub today.


### Day 6: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to more active tutorials, reviewed the material I had previously covered on DOM maniupulation and single element selectors in the [Traversy Media Course on vanilla JS](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WqkBEUeeV5STXo=/) I've been trying to make my way through.

**Thoughts:** I feel more confident this time around. A little rusty in my HTML/CSS but I'm confident it will come back to me. Tomorrow may try some of my own experiments using this template.

I'm also realizing I really need to resume my habit of creating flash cards in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) as I learn. It is a slower learning process but retentions is leaps and bounds better. I would find it less frustrating and there would be less need for review every time I sit down.

### Day 7: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Multiple element selectors today. I understand the function, it's the syntax that's a little bit difficult to rememeber.

**Thoughts:** Wow, it's been a whole week.

### Day 8: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More DOM manipulation, including creation and insertion of HTML elements into the DOM from JS. Pretty cool!

**Thoughts:** I've got about an hour left in this tutorial before the first project. I do want to finish up before I proceed but I'm getting a little antsy because I think I've already figured out how to do it.

### Day 9: May 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much time today and didn't feel like listening to a tutorial so put on some music and tried my best to replicate the test document with the HTML I remember.

**Thoughts:** I actually did pretty well. Needed a reminder on some tags, but the move to semantic tags in HTML5 makes structuring a document much easier to follow. Unfortunately when double checking the tutorial document, I realized it's reliant on Bootstrap and is an absolute clusterfuck of `<div>`s. Will probably end up rewriting from the ground up when I do it myself. It's a simple page, I don't anticipate much difficulty other than styling.

### Days 10-12: May 8, 10, 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still working through tutorial. Learning about DOM manipulation and now Event Listeners.

**Thoughts:** I keep forgetting to log. :neutral_face:

### Day 13: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Messing around with mouse events.

**Thoughts:** I can see some practical applications for some of the weird things you can do with JS.
