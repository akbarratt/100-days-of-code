# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the #100DaysOfCode repo, made adjustments to the goals, and spent 50 minutes reading and taking notes on [Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

**Thoughts:** I forgot I was supposed to start this challenge today and I am very, very tired.

**Link to work:** You're looking at it.
